# HomeShare_Symfony

This site is a project that I work on to learn and practice the basics of Symfony 5.
I will build a site that allows owners of properties, house or appartment, to share it for holydays, weekend, or else.
In order to focus on the technical part of the project, I will follow the specifications sheet provide in an other course.
